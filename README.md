# nfc_card
This is an adaptation of the OnBoard jam with my own antenna. It is designed in KiCad, with this plugin:
[https://github.com/Neurotech-Hub/KiCad-Plugins-8.0](https://github.com/Neurotech-Hub/KiCad-Plugins-8.0).

I also designed a simple enclosure, which is to be printed out of TPU for a bit of edge protection to add
the card to a keyring. Due to the cost of the PCB and the assembly, I plan to keep the board and to tap
it to transmit my contact info, rather than necessarily handing out the contraption.

the housing's design files.
